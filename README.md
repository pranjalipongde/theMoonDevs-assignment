### Fragmenting UI into Selective Components

In this project, the task was to fragment the UI of a React component into selective components to improve readability and maintainability. The original component, `BurnPage`, contained a lot of JSX code and logic, making it difficult to understand and maintain. 

To address this, I broke down the UI into separate components, namely `BurnStatsContainer`, `TransactionTable`, `ChainSelector`, and `AppToast`. Each component is responsible for rendering a specific section of the UI, making the code more organized and easier to manage.

#### Justification for Fragmentation:

1. **Modularity**: By breaking down the UI into separate components, we promote modularity. Each component encapsulates a specific piece of functionality, making it easier to reuse and maintain.

2. **Readability**: Fragmenting the UI improves readability by separating concerns. Developers can focus on understanding and working with smaller, more manageable components rather than dealing with a monolithic structure.

3. **Scalability**: As the application grows, having modular components allows for easier scalability. New features or changes can be implemented more efficiently by adding or modifying individual components without impacting other parts of the application.

4. **Code Reusability**: With modular components, we can reuse them across different parts of the application. This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication, leading to a more efficient development process.

Overall, fragmenting the UI into selective components enhances code organization, readability, maintainability, and scalability, making it a beneficial approach for building and maintaining complex React applications.

### Task Completion

I have completed the task "Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable" as specified. The UI has been successfully broken down into separate components, improving the overall structure and maintainability of the codebase.
